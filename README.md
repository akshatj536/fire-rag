# fire-rag

**fire-rag** is a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project.  

The core idea of this project is to use **summarization of multimodal data** for building embeddings and enabling retrieval. Instead of directly embedding raw data from different modalities, the data is first summarized into a compact representation. These summaries are then embedded into a vector space, making it easier to perform retrieval and generate context-aware responses.  

Additionally, **fire-rag** integrates **CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining)** embeddings within the RAG framework to bridge text and visual data effectively.

## ðŸ”Ž Overview
- **Multimodal Input**: Works with text, images, and other modalities.  
- **Summarization First**: Summarizes multimodal content into concise, information-dense representations.  
- **Embedding & Retrieval**: Creates embeddings using both summarization-based and CLIP-based models.  
- **RAG Pipeline**: Combines retrieval and generation for context-aware answers.  
- **CLIP Model Integration**: Uses CLIP to generate joint embeddings for textâ€“image pairs, enriching the retrieval process.  

---

## âœ¨ Key Points
- Focus on **summarization-based embeddings** for efficient information capture.  
- Integrates **CLIP embeddings** to align text and image features in a shared semantic space.  
- Enables **multimodal retrieval** by combining summarized embeddings with CLIP outputs.  
- Retrieval is contextually accurate due to the hybrid embedding strategy.  
- Modular pipeline: summarization â†’ embedding (CLIP + text) â†’ retrieval â†’ generation.

## ðŸš€ Project Flow
1. **Data Ingestion** â€“ Multimodal data (text, images, videos, etc.) is collected.  
2. **Summarization** â€“ Each piece of data is summarized into a compact textual or structured form.  
3. **Embedding** â€“ Two types of embeddings are created:
   - **Text Summarization Embeddings** (using language models)  
   - **CLIP Embeddings** (for image and text alignment)  
4. **Retrieval** â€“ Given a query, relevant embeddings (textual or visual) are retrieved.  
5. **Generation** â€“ Retrieved results are passed to the RAG generator to produce a coherent, context-aware response.

## ðŸ§  CLIP Model Implementation

Below is a simplified representation of how **CLIP** is integrated into the RAG pipeline:

```python
from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch

# Load pretrained CLIP model
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")

# Example: Compute CLIP embeddings for an image-text pair
inputs = processor(
    text=["a photo of a fire truck"],
    images=["fire_truck.jpg"],
    return_tensors="pt",
    padding=True
)

# Generate embeddings
outputs = model(**inputs)
image_embeds = outputs.image_embeds
text_embeds = outputs.text_embeds

# Combine embeddings for multimodal retrieval
combined_embeds = torch.cat((text_embeds, image_embeds), dim=1)
