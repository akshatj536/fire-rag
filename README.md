# fire-rag

**fire-rag** is a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project.  

The core idea of this project is to use **summarization of multimodal data** for building embeddings and enabling retrieval. Instead of directly embedding raw data from different modalities, the data is first summarized into a compact representation. These summaries are then embedded into a vector space, making it easier to perform retrieval and generate context-aware responses.

## ðŸ”Ž Overview
- **Multimodal Input**: Works with data from multiple modalities (text, images, videos, etc.).
- **Summarization First**: Summarizes the multimodal data into a concise form before creating embeddings.
- **Embedding & Retrieval**: Uses the summarized representations to build embeddings, which are stored for retrieval.
- **RAG Pipeline**: Retrieved information is then used in a retrieval-augmented generation setup.

---

## âœ¨ Key Points
- Focus on **summarization-based embeddings** rather than raw modality embeddings.
- Retrieval is more efficient and contextually accurate because embeddings are derived from summaries.
- Designed to handle **multimodal datasets** in a unified pipeline.
- Modular approach: summarization â†’ embedding â†’ retrieval â†’ generation.

## ðŸš€ Project Flow
1. **Data Ingestion** â€“ Multimodal data is collected.  
2. **Summarization** â€“ Each piece of data is summarized into a compact textual (or structured) form.  
3. **Embedding** â€“ The summaries are converted into embeddings.  
4. **Retrieval** â€“ Given a query, the system retrieves relevant summarized embeddings.  
5. **Generation** â€“ Retrieved results are used for generating the final response.

## âš¡ Usefulness
This approach helps in:  
- Reducing the complexity of handling raw multimodal inputs.  
- Improving retrieval quality by focusing on the essence of data.  
- Making multimodal RAG more scalable and efficient.
